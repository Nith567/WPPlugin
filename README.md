# **WPAgent — Fair AI Agent for WordPress Creators**

Turn your WordPress blog into an income stream by preventing illegal scraping and enabling AI-safe monetization.

WPAgent is a lightweight, on-chain monetization layer for WordPress — built for the new age of AI agents, LLM scrapers, and automated content consumers.
It lets creators protect their content, get paid fairly, and participate in an open ecosystem of agent-based access.

## **🌍 Background**

Over **40 percent** of the internet runs on WordPress.
Every day, millions of creators publish tutorials, guides, essays, documentation, and niche expertise.

But AI systems, automated crawlers, and unauthorized bots scrape this content **without consent**, **without attribution**, and **without compensation**.
This content is later used for:

* LLM training
* search query answering
* chatbot responses
* knowledge graph construction
* derivative content generation

Creators receive **zero** of the value they generate.

This imbalance has widened with the rise of autonomous agents — which freely consume creator content while the original authors remain unprotected.

## **💡 Solution — WPAgent**

WPAgent restores power to creators by giving them a simple way to **control, monetize, and grant access** to their content.

It integrates directly into your WordPress dashboard, letting you turn any post or page into a pay-gated, AI-safe, agent-compatible resource.

### **Key Features**

#### **🪪 1. Wallet-Linked Creator Identity**

Creators can connect their crypto wallet to receive frictionless, on-chain payments.
This enables global, permissionless payouts without intermediaries.

#### **💵 2. Set Your Price in `usdfc`**

Each post or page can have a custom price denominated in **usdfc**, enabling a stable, predictable pricing model.

#### **⚡ 3. One-Click Monetization via `x402 Protocol`**

WPAgent integrates with the **x402** protocol — an emerging standard for agent-to-website payments.
With one click, creators can:

* Enable x402 pay-per-access
* Generate protected shortcodes
* Automatically lock content until payment is verified

Agents and users pay before accessing the content.

#### **🔐 4. Access Control for AI Agents & Humans**

Only verified paying entities — whether human users or autonomous agents — can view the full content.

The plugin:

* Blocks unauthorized scraping
* Prevents direct URL bypass
* Ensures agents comply with your paywall
* Generates verified access receipts via x402

#### **📈 5. Simple Dashboard for Creators**

View:

* Total earnings
* Post-level revenue
* Access logs
* Agent payment activity
* Wallet status

Everything is visible from a single page.

## **🧩 How It Works**

1. **Install the WPAgent plugin** on your WordPress site
2. **Connect your crypto wallet** (Metamask, WalletConnect etc.)

4. WPAgent automatically:

   * Wraps protected content
   * Adds an agent-readable x402 payment header
   * Verifies access tokens
   * Shows a payment prompt to unauthorized users
5. **Users or agents pay in usdfc**
6. WPAgent unlocks the content in real time after payment confirmation

## **🔮 Why WPAgent Matters**

WPAgent is part of a broader shift where:

* Websites are no longer passive HTML pages
* Content becomes an API endpoint
* Humans and agents both interact with websites programmatically
* Payments become natively integrated into web requests

Creators deserve to be part of this economy instead of being exploited by opaque AI training pipelines.

WPAgent helps creators **own their distribution**, **protect their content**, and **get paid fairly**.
